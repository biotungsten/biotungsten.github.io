# The windmill

The windmill
The windmill is unstoppably turning
Driven by the the winds churning
The grain on the fields below 
Must be gathered and the silos overflow

The ball
The overweight are dancing on ther ball
Their moves are driven by the wind in the hall
They are laughing at the folk eating bread


# Background

This poem is loosely based on a poem a good friend of mine and I wrote when in school, after we were assigned to do so by a substitute teacher. Our goal at the time wasn't to write a poem that makes sense, but rather to write a complex poem, one that would seem impressive. After all, the poem we wrote was complex, but far more importantly, it also made sense. In this poem I corrected the mistakes we made by trying to achieve high complexity, while highlighting the deeper meaning we put into the poem.
